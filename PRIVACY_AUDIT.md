# Privacy Audit

Ghost Pepper claims to be 100% local by default. This file is both the audit prompt and the record of the most recent verification.

## How to verify

Paste the following prompt into Claude Code (or any AI assistant with codebase access) from the repo root:

> Review the Ghost Pepper codebase and confirm that all default features run 100% locally with no network calls. Specifically verify:
>
> 1. **Speech-to-text** — transcription runs entirely on-device (WhisperKit, FluidAudio, Qwen3-ASR). No audio is sent to any server.
> 2. **Text cleanup** — the local Qwen LLM cleans up transcriptions on-device. No text is sent to any API.
> 3. **Audio recording** — mic and system audio capture use AVAudioEngine and ScreenCaptureKit only. No audio is streamed or uploaded.
> 4. **Meeting transcription & summarization** — chunked transcription, markdown storage, and LLM summary generation all happen locally. No meeting content leaves the device.
> 5. **OCR & screen capture** — Vision framework runs on-device. Screenshots are processed locally and never transmitted.
> 6. **File storage** — all meeting notes, transcripts, and summaries are saved as local markdown files. No cloud sync, no remote backup.
> 7. **No third-party tracking SDKs** — confirm there are no tracking SDKs (Firebase, Mixpanel, Sentry, Amplitude, PostHog, Datadog, Segment, etc.) anywhere in the codebase. Local-only usage counters (UserDefaults) power the in-app Usage report panel — verify they don't make network calls.
>
> For each item, check the relevant source files and confirm no `URLSession`, `URLRequest`, or HTTP URL strings exist in the core feature code. List any cloud-connected features separately and confirm they are all opt-in (disabled by default, require user-provided API keys).
>
> Output your findings as a checklist with pass/fail for each item.

## Most recent audit

**Date:** 2026-04-13

**Commit:** (run `git rev-parse --short HEAD` to fill in)

### Core features (must be 100% local)

| # | Feature | Files checked | Result |
|---|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Speech-to-text | `SpeechTranscriber.swift`, `ChunkedTranscriptionPipeline.swift` | :white_check_mark: Pass — no network calls. Inference runs via WhisperKit/FluidAudio on-device. |
| 2 | Text cleanup | `MeetingSummaryGenerator.swift`, `TextCleanupManager.swift` (inference path only) | :white_check_mark: Pass — LLM inference via LLM.swift, fully on-device. `TextCleanupManager` has model download code but that is user-initiated, not part of inference. |
| 3 | Audio recording | `Audio/AudioRecorder.swift`, `Audio/SystemAudioRecorder.swift`, `Audio/DualStreamCapture.swift` | :white_check_mark: Pass — AVAudioEngine (mic) and ScreenCaptureKit (system audio). No network calls. |
| 4 | Meeting transcription & storage | `MeetingSession.swift`, `MeetingTranscript.swift`, `MeetingMarkdownWriter.swift`, `MeetingHistory.swift`, `MeetingTranscriptSettings.swift` | :white_check_mark: Pass — all local file I/O. Markdown written to user-chosen directory. |
| 5 | OCR & screen capture | `Input/WindowCaptureService.swift`, Vision framework usage | :white_check_mark: Pass — Apple Vision framework, on-device only. |
| 6 | File storage | `MeetingMarkdownWriter.swift`, `MeetingHistory.swift` | :white_check_mark: Pass — local filesystem only. No iCloud, CloudKit, or remote sync. |
| 7 | No third-party tracking SDKs | Entire `GhostPepper/` directory | :white_check_mark: Pass — no Firebase, Mixpanel, Sentry, Amplitude, PostHog, Datadog, or Segment SDKs found. Local-only usage counters (UserDefaults) power the in-app Usage report panel. |

### Cloud-connected features (all opt-in)

These features require explicit user action and API keys. They are **disabled by default**.

| Feature | Trigger | API key required |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Zo AI chat | User configures API key in Settings | Yes (`pepperChatApiKey`) |
| Trello integration | User configures API key + token in Settings | Yes (`trelloApiKey`, `trelloToken`) |
| Granola meeting import | User clicks Import and enters API key | Yes (`granolaApiKey`) |
| Model downloads | User selects a model to download | No (public Hugging Face URLs) |
| Sparkle update check | Automatic, checks GitHub appcast.xml 1x/24h | No |

### Verdict

:white_check_mark: **All default features run 100% locally. No user data leaves the device unless the user explicitly configures a cloud integration.**
